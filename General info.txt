Info:

- Find a suitable use case
- Put at least a picture of system to identify
- Apply the suitable controls according to the framework and fit the best 
- If we use generative AI, use it to apply such case to what you want to see 
- It's important to select categories and subcategories according to the specific case, then standard will pave the way on how to do that
- Even where there is not a standard, remember to apply concepts: these are always the same, refining them accordingly

Bureaucracy:

- It has to be delivered 10 days before the exams
- If exam goes wrong, the same report, if it goes well, can be used

Moodle says (for 23-24):
The final exam consist of the sum of the points each student scores in two tests:

A report up to 10 pages maximum, in which the candidate should analyze a cybersecurity assessment report built with Generative AI
 - The cybersecurity assessment prepared with the use of generative AI should comply with the NIST CSF 2.0.
 - Instead, the report should introduce the AI-based assessment and the methodology used to construct it.
 - Finally, the candidate must spend particular effort analysing what the AI has produced and any mitigations that a security engineer could use to contrast this fraudulent way of writing reports.
 - It is important that the report be submitted at least seven days before the date of the examination in which you wish to participate
